Please consider citing the papers if you use this code.

CAUTION

**The 'full' package is not completely up to date, use it only if you need to re-train the Pareto front or the ranking in MCG, then use 'pre-trained' to do the actual computations.**

**'Full' and 'Pre-Trained' packages not compatible with Windows.**
